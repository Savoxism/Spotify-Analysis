Key Takeaways:
This year the data was logged from January 1st 00:00 to November 15th 23:59. What you listen from November 16th to December 31th is pretty much ignored

Your top songs are calculated by play count rather than total time listened.

In your top 100 playlist only the first 10 songs are sorted by play count, the rest are close but sorted by artist.

Your total time listening includes podcasts.

Your top artists are calculated by total play counts rather than total time listening.
