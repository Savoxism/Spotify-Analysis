Me in 2023: Users will see which of a dozen Spotify-created characters best describes their listening habits. Examples of characters include the Shapeshifter (“you’re quick to move from one artist to the next”), the Luminary (“you play light, upbeat music more than others”), and the Alchemist (“you create your own playlists more than others do”).
Sound Town: Users will be matched to a city based on listening data and shared artist affinity. Cities can be anywhere around the world

Key Takeaways:
This year the data was logged from January 1st 00:00 to November 15th 23:59. What you listen from November 16th to December 31th is pretty much ignored

You have to listen to a song for more than 30 seconds for it to count in your song rankings.

Your top songs are calculated by play count rather than total time listened. ((ez workaround))

In your top 100 playlist only the first 10 songs are sorted by play count, the rest are close but sorted by artist.

Your total time listening includes podcasts.

Your top 5 artists are calculated by total play counts rather than total time listening. (ez workaround)

You can only investigate playlists that you created, not by others and by Spotify (looking for workaround)
